# My Project
I made a web app that allows you to rent out what you want to, to other users. For example if you want to rent out bikes, boats, your phone anything that you think someone might want/could use and you can put prices and pay with real money.  It is currently in devmode which means, it doesn't really work until I switch it. But anyone can use it and you can post any items in 3 categories activties, tools, technologies.
